# Mitosis-Simple-simulation
This project is a my implementation mitosis simulation in C#
Anserw to youtube video from channel coding train: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxGS3fKPKJA&t=1s

* simulation speed changing only by changing move clock interval
* cells spliting on click
* cells have a life value showed inside the cell
* cells have a chance  to split by yourself every 500 life cycles
* cells dying after 2k cycles

Clicking on watching cells is so satisfying :)
